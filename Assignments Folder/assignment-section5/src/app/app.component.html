<!--
<p>Bind It!</p>
<p>Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even</p>
<p>The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game</p>
<p>When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())</p>
<p>The event should be listenable from outside the component</p>
<p>>When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))</p>
<p>A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)</p>
<p>Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components</p>
<p>Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components</p>
